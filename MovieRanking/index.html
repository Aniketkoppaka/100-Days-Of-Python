<h1>My Top 3 Comfort Comedies ðŸŽ¬</h1>
<h2>Movies That Never Fail to Make Me Laugh (No Matter How Many Times I Rewatch)</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. The Hangover (2009)</h3>
<p>
    Todd Phillips struck gold with this outrageous bachelor-party-gone-wrong classic. Itâ€™s absurd, chaotic, and somehow still tightly structured. The chemistry between Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis is pure comedy magic. Easily one of the most quotable films of the 2000s.

<h3>2. 21 Jump Street (2012)</h3>
<p>
    A perfect balance of action and parody. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have an unexpectedly perfect buddy-cop dynamic, and the film cleverly satirizes high school, police tropes, and rebootsâ€”all while being genuinely hilarious. Phil Lord and Chris Miller understood the assignment.

<h3>3. Superbad (2007)</h3>
<p>
    The ultimate coming-of-age comedy. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg when they were teenagers, it captures awkward youth with uncanny precision. Michael Cera and Jonah Hill give iconic performances, and who could forget McLovin? It's crude, chaotic, and somehow still heartfelt.
